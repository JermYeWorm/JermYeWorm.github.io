Hemodynamic signals, such as Electrocardiogram (ECG), Photoplethysmography (PPG), and Electrical Bioimpedance (EBI), provide a myriad of critical health indicators. For instance, ECG is utilized by cardiologists to diagnose a range of cardiovascular diseases, PPG estimates blood oxygen levels, and EBI gauges vascular flow. A multimodal device capable of continuously monitoring these signals can furnish healthcare professionals with profound insights into patient well-being. This paper introduces a hardware design for a programmable, wearable device that measures multiple physiological signals, including ECG, PPG, and EBI. Equipped with an onboard microprocessor, the device enables real-time data processing. Compact and efficient, the system measures just 60.5mm by 38.75mm, has low-power dissipation, and is powered by a coin cell battery. Using largely discrete commercial components and a custom electrode array, the open-source hardware allows for rapid configurability and broad usage applications within the health monitoring domain.
