Hi everyone! I'm an undergraduate Electrical Engineering student at the University of Maryland with a strong interest in both electrical and biomedical engineering. This website includes some projects to highlight my recent work.

My core technical interests include analog and mixed-signal IC design, energy-efficient computing for resource-constrained environments, and real-time embedded signal processing for physiological monitoring. I have a background with end-to-end engineering across diverse domains, including semiconductor chip design, medical device development, and spacecraft systems. I'm also interested in translating cutting-edge research into practical solutions, with experience in technology commercialization, customer discovery, translational grants, and clinical collaborations.

I currently conduct research with Dr. Sahil Shah at the University of Maryland, leading the development of a novel wearable for continuous vascular surveillance, aimed at addressing unmet clinical needs in dialysis care. Our seminal paper outlining this work can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS60917.2024.10658959). Recent efforts have focused on commercialization through NSF I-Corps and MII Phase I grants, supporting company spinout formation. In 2024, I also presented a spotlight funding pitch at the National SBIR Innovation Summit in Austin, TX, highlighting our technology's application in hemorrhagic shock prediction (view the pitch deck [here](http://jermyeworm.github.io/files/DTC_2024_Pitch_Slide_Deck.pdf)). Following industry interest, a provisional patent was filed and an IP licensing agreement was secured earlier this year with a commercial partner.

Recently, I finished a 7-month stint as a spacecraft engineering co-op at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, helping design, build, and test electronics for interplanetary NASA missions, mainly NASA's nuclear-powered [Dragonfly](https://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/) rotorcraft mission to Titan. Prior to this, I worked on spacecraft systems software at the US Naval Research Lab under a Secret clearance. Before college, I was a Bio-MEMS research assistant under Professor Abraham Lee, where I worked on a novel intracellular delivery microfluidic platform ([AESOP](https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202102021)).

Beyond academics, I enjoy golf, cooking, history, and hiking, and I currently help run the UMD Juggling Club! Check us out [here](https://www.instagram.com/umdjugglingclub/)!
