I'm currently an undergraduate electrical engineering student at the University of Maryland. 

I'm interested in energy-efficient wearable devices for physiological monitoring, analog and mixed-signal IC design, and real-time embedded ML processing for diagnostics. I have experience with full-stack end-to-end hardware and software system bring-up. 

I am currently doing research in the Shah Lab at the University of Maryland, leading a project on a novel impedance plethysmography monitoring wearable device for surgical site monitoring of dialysis patients. Check out our seminal paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS60917.2024.10658959).

I recently gave a spotlight funding pitch at the 2024 National SBIR Innovation Summit in Austin, TX as part of the Defense TechConnect to commercialize our research into a hemorrhagic shock prediction device. Check out our pitch deck [here](http://jermyeworm.github.io/files/DTC_2024_Pitch_Slide_Deck.pdf).

Previously, I interned at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory as a spacecraft power engineer, designing and testing analog electronics for NASA's Dragonfly rotorcraft mission to Titan. Prior to that, I worked on spacecraft systems software at the US Naval Research Lab under a Secret clearance.

Before college, I was a Bio-MEMS research assistant under Professor Abraham Lee, where I worked on a novel intracellular delivery microfluidic platform. Check out the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202102021).

In my free time, I enjoy golf, cooking, and hiking. I am also the President of the UMD Juggling Club! Check us out [here](https://www.instagram.com/umdjugglingclub/)!
