title: "Low-Power Wide Linear Output Range CMOS Biopotential Amplifier"
excerpt: "Designed a two-stage 1.8V CMOS biopotential amplifier for a wearable biomedical instrumentation 
frontend with internal gain enhancement switch feedback. Used the Skywater 130nm Process and simulated with 
the Cadence Design Suite. Verified 85dB CMRR, 0.15V to 1.7V output range with stable gain, 10µW power, and 
100kHz bandwidth.<br/>
