In the area of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, a wideband injection transformer is often an engineer's best friend. 
Unfortunately, these are often inaccessible both in terms of cost and scalability, creating the need for a custom solution. More 
importantly, I am not about to pay $600 to Omicron Lab for a toroid with some wire. This report serves as a design outline for a 
wideband EMI injection transformer, as well as a general guide for the rapid prototyping of practical custom magnetics.

This report was something I made for fun while interning at JHU APL.
