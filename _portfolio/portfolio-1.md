title: "Low-Power Wide Linear Output Range CMOS Biopotential Amplifier"
excerpt: "Designed a two-stage 1.8V CMOS biopotential amplifier for a wearable biomedical instrumentation frontend with internal gain enhancement switch feedback. Used the Skywater 130nm Process and simulated with the Cadence Design Suite. Verified 85dB CMRR, 0.15V to 1.7V output range with stable gain, 10ÂµW power, and 100kHz bandwidth.<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
