The following details my research on a remote patient monitoring wearable platform capable of measuring multiple hemodynamic 
biosignals continuously, to be used to address unmet vascular surveillance needs in chronic clinical conditions. All listed 
work was completed with Dr. Sahil Shah at the University of Maryland. Recent work has been focused on commercialization efforts 
through NSF I-Corps and MII Phase 1 grants to support company spinout formation. Following commercial interest, a provisional 
patent has been filed and an IP licensing agreement with an industry partner was achieved earlier this year.

The link below directs to our seminal paper on a non-invasive, multimodal, configurable, hemodynamic monitoring 
wearable device capable of onboard processing. Published last year, the work was presented at IEEE MWSCAS 2024 
(slides embedded above). The paper was selected as a top contribution to the conference and invited to a Special 
Issue in the IEEE Open Journal of Circuits and Systems.
